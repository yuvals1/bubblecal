 pressing space in the text boxs of title and description in the event modal  doesn't work
 the colors of the events are not showing at the weekly view
in agendas and list view, can we remove the dot at the start and make the event text itself have the color 
can we add yanking functionality. that means when we press y we can then press p in antoher day and the event would paste to it
remove the dot from the weekly and daily view
